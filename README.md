Description:
This is a computational physics project that aims to simulate the complex gravitational interactions between three (or more) celestial bodies in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Using numerical methods such as leapfrog integration technique and the aid of Newton's law of universal gravitation, calculating the dynamic properties of the bodies over time.

Key Features:

Simulation Engine: Implements numerical algorithms to accurately model the gravitational forces between multiple bodies.
Visualization: Provides visual representation of the simulated system using matplotlib, allowing users to observe the motion of the bodies in real-time.
Customization: Allows users to specify initial conditions such as mass, position, and velocity of each body, as well as the duration and time step of the simulation.
Flexible Dimensionality: Supports both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations, enabling exploration of gravitational interactions in different spatial contexts.
Educational Tool: Serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts to understand fundamental concepts of celestial mechanics and numerical simulations.

Technologies Used:
Python programming language
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib for data visualization

Potential Extensions:
Implement more advanced numerical integration methods for increased accuracy.
Implement more convenient ways to pass on known systems of bodies.
Supply typical and illustrative system of bodies like the system Sun-Earth-Moon.
Incorporate user-friendly interfaces for parameter configuration and interactive exploration.
